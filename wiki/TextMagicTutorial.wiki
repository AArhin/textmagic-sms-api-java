#summary !TextMagic java api tutorial

= Introduction =

This tutorial is designed to provide a basic overview of how to use !TextMagic java api. When you have completed the tutorial you will have written a simple web-application that sends and receives sms messages through !TextMagic Sms Gateway.

= Getting started =

First of all you need to create account on [https://www.textmagic.com/app/wt/account/api/cmd/password !TextMagic]

Then you need to download 
 * [http://code.google.com/p/textmagic-sms-api-java/downloads/list textmagic-sms-api.jar] 
and its dependencies:
 * [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-httpclient/commons-httpclient/3.1/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar Apache Commons http-client]
 * [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/json/json/20090211/json-20090211.jar org.json JSON parsing library]
 * [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.1/commons-logging-1.1.jar Apache Commons Logging]

The !TextMagic java api requires jdk 1.5 and above.

= Instantiating !TextMagicMessageService =

By default the constructor of !TextMagicMessageService requires 2 parameters: your !TextMagic account username and password.

{{{
TextMagicMessageService service = new TextMagicMessageService ("you_username", "your_password");
}}}

This creates thread-safe instance of the service facade.

= Sending Messages =

The api provides set of convinient methods for sending sms messages (please refer to javadoc for complete specification).
The most common used method for sending message to one number is

{{{
SentMessage message = service.send("9991234567", "text");
}}}

Lets write jsp page for sending sms messages containing 2 form fields destination number and message text to be sent.
